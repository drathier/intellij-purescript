## Status

You want to build this yourself; the version in the normal plugin repository is very out of date. See Dev instructions below.

This plugin is still in the **early stages of development** so only has a handful of features. But over time things will stabilize and more features will be added.
 
## Usage

Visit [intellij-purescript.github.io] to find documentation about installation and features.
